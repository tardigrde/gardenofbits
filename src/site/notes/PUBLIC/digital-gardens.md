# Cultivating a Digital Garden

In the digital age, the concept of [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) has taken on a new dimension. The idea of a *digital garden* has emerged as a unique approach to cultivating and nurturing our thoughts and ideas. 

Unlike traditional blogging, which is often a performative act, digital gardening is more akin to a captain's log, a space for real-time editing, evolving thinking, and high cadence thoughts.

The essence of digital gardening lies in the act of collecting and more importantly **connecting the dots** in a knowledge (data)base. 

The longevity of our digital gardens is ensured by the use of open standards and tools. 

The digital garden is a testament to the power of the open web, a space that is not forced but organically grown. It's a space where we can learn in public, sharing our thoughts and ideas without the pressure of the 'publish' button. It's a space where we can experiment, make mistakes, and grow, both as individuals and as part of the wider digital community.
