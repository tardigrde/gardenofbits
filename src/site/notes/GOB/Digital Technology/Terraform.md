# Terraform

[Terraform by HashiCorp](https://www.terraform.io/) is the industry-standard Infrastructure as Code tool. I love its simplicity. On the other hand, [HashiCorp adopts Business Source License](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license), which is not so friendly to say the least. Hopefully [[GOB/Digital Technology/DeCloud/OpenTofu\|OpenTofu]] will be up to the task.
