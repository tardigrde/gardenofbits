# Public Clouds

What does it mean to be in the cloud?


# GCP

I have the opportunity to work with Google Cloud on a daily basis. We develop and operate a [Landing zone](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/landing-zones). 

I studied [GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric) extensively. I love the simplicity in [Terraform by HashiCorp](https://www.terraform.io/). 

On the other hand, [HashiCorp adopts Business Source License](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license), which is not so friendly to say the least. Hopefully [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) will be up to the task.
