# Google Cloud Platform

I have the opportunity to work with Google Cloud on a daily basis. We develop and operate a [Landing zone](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/landing-zones). 

I studied [GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric) extensively. It is quite an abstraction. Written in [[GOB/Digital Technology/Terraform\|Terraform]], the code itself is kept minimal, but it is powerful.
