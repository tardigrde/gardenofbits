# Open source

I have contributed to some [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) projects, but I exploited it way more than I contributed to. Like not even a fair comparison. But this shall change. 

In my view, Open Source is the opposite of [Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). A true `2+2=5` situation.
