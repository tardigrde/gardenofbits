## Why I hate Windows
- closed source enterprise software
- vendor lock-in
- lack of user freedom and control
- tracks you all the time
- slow bootup, slow/bloated in general
	- uses too much RAM
- forced updates are a nightmare
- can't update system packages without rebooting
- vague error messages
- big tech company with too much power already. we need diversity instead of [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly)
- lack of UX configuration, e.g. no focus follows mouse
- CMD is just plain stupid, PowerShell is clunky
- hard to grasp directory strucutre for system files
- not [Everything is a file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file)
- programming in windows painful at best
- bad energy management
- ads
- searching for software is annoying
- paid software all over the place
