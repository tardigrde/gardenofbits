According to the infamous Tech Lead YT channel (purposefully not linking to it), coding is no longer a superpower. It was for a long time. Back in the day, 1 person could write an app that had no rivals, they blew up, and suddenly the lone developer would find himself negotiating with VCs.

I typically approach his content with skepticism due to his tendency to exaggerate. However, he does make a valid argument.

Creating a meaningful website or app now requires a substantial amount of effort. Most of the time they are done in teams. Furthermore, such platforms often serve primarily as ad space. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok offer better profitability and demand significantly less input. 

But they are not an option for me :). I think to make a difference, you do not necessarily need a full-blown web app, or a popular account on some social media platform. You just need something to say, and an audience. Email is still one of the most robust ways to reach people, since it's platformless.
