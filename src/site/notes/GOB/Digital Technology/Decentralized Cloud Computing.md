# Decentralized Cloud Computing


![decloud.png|420](/img/user/GOB/assets/images/decloud.png)

The global cloud computing market was $545.8 billion, and is set to exceed $1000 billion by 2027, with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure holding a combined market share of more than 60%. [^1]  

The growth is driven by increased consumer demand, smartphone usage, development of web and mobile applications, and the high cost of on-site server management. However, current cloud services lack flexibility and have high recurring costs. With 85% of server capacity underused and growing global demand, there is a need for a more distributed, flexible and cost-effective cloud infrastructure.
