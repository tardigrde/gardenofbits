# Decentralized Cloud Computing


![decloud.png|420](/img/user/GOB/assets/images/decloud.png)

## Global Cloud Market 
The global cloud computing market was $545.8 billion, and is set to exceed $1000 billion by 2027, with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure holding a combined market share of more than 60%. [^1] These [[GOB/Digital Technology/Public Clouds\|Public Clouds]] are getting way ahaed.

The growth is driven by increased consumer demand, smartphone usage, development of web and mobile applications, and the high cost of on-site server management. However, current cloud services lack flexibility and have high recurring costs. With 85% of server capacity underused and growing global demand, there is a need for a more distributed, flexible and cost-effective cloud infrastructure. 

## Why Decentralized Cloud Computing

TODO

Only [[GOB/Digital Technology/Open Source\|Open Source]] can achieve this.
## Storage
Let's start with storage, because that's maybe the least problematic.
## IPFS
I created [[GOB/Blog/IPFS  Uncovered\|IPFS  Uncovered]] to get myself through the basics.

## Compute
[[GOB/Digital Technology/DeCloud/Flux\|Flux]] and [[GOB/Digital Technology/DeCloud/Akash network\|Akash network]] do a lot to bring DeCloud to life. 

## Tools
[[GOB/Digital Technology/DeCloud/OpenTofu\|OpenToFu]] hopefully can help these platforms grow.
