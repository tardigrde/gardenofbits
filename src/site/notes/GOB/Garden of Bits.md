# Garden of Bits

![logo.png|250](/img/user/GOB/assets/images/logo.png)

Welcome to the [[GOB/Garden of Bits\|Garden of Bits]], a public [[GOB/Meta/Digital Gardens\|Digital Garden]] built with [oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). 

The `Garden of Bits` gives space for exploration and [[GOB/Meta/Learning in Public\|Learning in Public]]. It is where I collect, connect and share ideas. 

## How to use it?
You may find my guide [[GOB/Meta/How to use Garden of Bits\|How to use Garden of Bits]] useful, but feel free to explore this space in your own unique way. 

> [!WARNING] [Here be dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)
> The garden's primary function is to help myself better understand the world. So keep in mind:
> - notes and essays are unfinished (see [[GOB/Meta/Epistemic status system\|Epistemic status system]]), 
> - opinions are my own, 
> - some content (especially images) are generated, 
> - and you will find broken links.
