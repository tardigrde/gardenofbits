# Garden of Bits

![logo.png|250](/img/user/GOB/assets/images/logo.png)

Welcome to the [[GOB/Garden of Bits\|Garden of Bits]], a public [[GOB/Meta/Digital Gardens\|Digital Garden]]. 
The `Garden of Bits` is a place of exploration and [[GOB/Meta/Learning in Public\|Learning in Public]]. It is where I collect, connect and share ideas. 

You may find my guide [[GOB/Meta/How to use Garden of Bits\|How to use Garden of Bits]] useful, but feel free to explore this space in your own unique way. On the other hand, be warned: [Here be dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons). The garden's primary function is to help myself better mapping the world. Notes and essays are unfinished (see [[GOB/Meta/Epistemic status system\|Epistemic status system]]), opinions are my own, some content (especially images) are generated, and you will find broken links.

I am a huge fan [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), not just as a development model, but as a philosophy that fosters collaboration, transparency, and community. So please feel free to 
- [add a new GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/tardigrde/gardenofbits/discussions/new/choose),
- [raise an issue](https://github.com/tardigrde/gardenofbits/issues/new/choose).
