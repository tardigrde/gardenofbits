## Vitamin supplementation
### Proteins 
Proteins are the "building blocks" of our bodies, made up of a combination of 20 amino acids. Some of these can be produced by the body, others not or not in sufficient quantities.

The latter are called essential amino acids and are obtained from an external source through the food we eat. Foods of animal origin (meat, dairy products, eggs) contain all these amino acids at the same time, i.e. they are complete sources of protein.

The most excellent sources of plant protein are pulses and oilseeds, but only some of these are present. However, if some cereals are eaten alongside them, they can also be a primary source of protein when used together. A versatile, protein-rich meat substitute is wheat meat (seitan), which is available in health food shops.

### Calcium

- If you do not eat any animal products at all, including milk and dairy products, you should take calcium supplements. In this case, soya milk, calcium-fortified orange juice, oilseeds, cabbage, dried beans and fish can provide this mineral.

- In terms of calcium utilisation, it is best to avoid foods and drinks high in phosphorus, such as cola, semi-prepared and preserved foods.- What problems does a lack of it cause?Muscle cramps, twitching of the muscles in the mouth and around the eyes can occur.Prolonged absence can lead to thinning of bones and the onset of osteoporosis.


### Vitamin B12

- Vitamin B12 is essential for blood formation and supports protein metabolism. A strict vegan diet can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency. This is why it is necessary to supplement it with, for example, soya lecithin or brown rice.

- The problem is that, as the main sources are white fish, milk, eggs, yoghurt and meat, a vegan does not ingest this and may need to take a vitamin supplement.

- What problems does a lack of it cause? Severe anaemia, mood disorders, lethargy, depression. 

### Iron

- Leaving meat out can also lead to iron deficiency if you don't eat enough pulses, berries (rosehips, blackberries, cherries), spinach, salted fish, asparagus.The iron content of oilseeds is also high, with poppy seeds being prominent among them.- Vitamin C is essential for the absorption of iron and is found mainly in fresh fruit and vegetables, but it should be noted that cooking destroys a large proportion of them. Other good sources of vitamin C are sea buckthorn and parsley.

- What problems does a lack of it cause?You may have iron deficiency anaemia and an increased susceptibility to infections due to immune system weakness.External signs include chapped lips, slowed hair and nail growth.

### Zinc
Also a problem mineral because of absorption. Deficiency leads to impaired taste perception, general immune system weakness and slower wound healing.Legumes, oilseeds, especially pumpkin seeds, and whole grains are rich sources of zinc.

### Vitamin D
- Vitamin D supplementation should also be taken care of if you do not consume dairy products. This is crucial for bone strength, as without this vitamin calcium cannot be absorbed.

- Ideal sources of vitamin D are oatmeal, wheat germ, cold-pressed oils, eggs and moderate sunlight.- What problems are caused by a lack of it? Increased risk of osteoporosis.

___ 
Oilseeds are included among the foods to be consumed daily, but while the Loma Linda pyramid (see [Foodp Pyramid.pdf](https://www.vegetariannutrition.org/6icvn/food-pyramid.pdf)) prescribes dairy products occasionally, another recommends daily consumption, highlighting soya milk. It is important to note that soya milk is the same as animal milk in name only, since the former is a white drink obtained by soaking soya beans.

It contains all the nutrients found in cow's milk: protein, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B2 and B12, but it is not a substitute for animal milk.Sweets and eggs in both versions are considered a rare treat.
