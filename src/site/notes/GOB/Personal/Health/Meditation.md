# Meditation

Meditation is a practice that has been around for thousands of years. It offers a wide range of benefits for both mental and physical health, including reducing stress, improving sleep, and boosting mood.

At its core, meditation is about training your mind to focus and be present. It is also about calming your mind and connecting it to your body. When you meditate, you focus your attention on inner processes, while being in the present moment. This can be done in a variety of ways (see [types of meditation](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/meditation#types-of-meditation)). The means of meditation is not relevant, focus and attention is. 

# Why Meditate

Meditation improves your overall health. Hormone regulation is the key here. 
## Stress control
One of the most well-known benefits of meditation is its ability to reduce stress. When you're stressed, your body produces [cortisol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol), a hormone that can have negative effects on your health. Meditation helps to lower cortisol levels, which can lead to a reduction in stress symptoms such as anxiety, high blood pressure, and insomnia.

Improved stress control improves **sleep quality** too. Meditation helps to calm the mind and body, making it easier to get a good night's sleep.

## Better mood
Meditation helps to increase levels of serotonin and dopamine, two neurotransmitters that play a role in mood regulation. Regular meditation practice can lead to a more positive outlook on life and a greater sense of well-being.


# Risks
It can happen that your first meditation sessions feel like shit. You get up more stressed than you sit down. It happened to everyone. It takes a lot of time and practice to learn how to meditate and reap the benefits. 

You must learn to relax when you meditate. Never force it. Think of it as a chance to relax. Practice acceptance.
