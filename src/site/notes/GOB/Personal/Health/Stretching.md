# Stretching
## Rules
-  Don‚Äôt engage in static stretching before a run, rather do dynamic stretching
- At the end of the run, take 3+ minutes of easy jog to cool down.
- After a run, hold each stretch for 30-45 seconds; repeat once or twice on each side. Do not force it, you should feel mild tension but not pain.
-  Ease into each stretch; don‚Äôt bounce or force it
- Try to relax your muscles while holding the stretch!
- Breath deeply while you stretch. With each exhale, you can try to gently stretch the muscle a bit more.
