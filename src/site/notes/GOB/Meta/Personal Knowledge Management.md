# Personal Knowledge Management
**[Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)(PKM)** involves consolidating and refining one's knowledge to derive conclusions, generate novel ideas, or accomplish specific objectives.

Even the simple act of note-taking and structuring information during a classroom lecture can be viewed as a form of PKM.

A PKM system is often likened to a second brain, and designing it to mimic the workings of the human brain is the most intuitive approach. These systems typically operate as follows:

1. Information is input into the system.
2. The input undergoes processing, revision, reorganization, and similar operations.
3. Conclusions are drawn, and action is taken, with the input being stored for future reference.

Applying this workflow concept to [[GOB/Digital Technology/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] [[GOB/Meta/My Second Brain\|My Second Brain]], you can refer to the [[200 Resources/201 Memory Flow Interface/Practical Workflow of MFI\|Practical Workflow of MFI]].

PKM typically relies on a [[GOB/Meta/Personal Knowledge Database\|Personal Knowledge Database]] as its foundation.
