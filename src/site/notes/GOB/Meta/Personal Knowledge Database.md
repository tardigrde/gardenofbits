# Personal Knowledge Database

A Personal Knowledge Database (PKD) is a system or tool used to store, organize, and retrieve information and knowledge that an individual has acquired over time. This can include notes from books or articles, personal insights, ideas, project details, and more. Â   
  
The main goal of a PKD is to create a searchable and efficient repository of knowledge that can be easily accessed and used for reference, learning, or work. It can be as simple as a collection of text files in a folder, or as complex as a dedicated software application with features for tagging, linking, and searching content.  
  
A PKD can be particularly useful for lifelong learners, researchers, writers, and professionals who need to keep track of a lot of information and be able to recall it easily. It can help to enhance memory, improve understanding, and generate new ideas by connecting different pieces of information.

[[GOB/Meta/Personal Knowledge Management\|Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]] seeks to iterate on the database through certain workflows and principles.
