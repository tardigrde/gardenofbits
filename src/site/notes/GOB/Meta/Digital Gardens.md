# Digital Gardens

## Definition
`Digital Garden` is a unique approach to cultivating and nurturing our thoughts and ideas in a (public) digital place. It's like a personal Wiki site for [[GOB/Meta/Personal Knowledge Management\|Personal Knowledge Management]].

The essence of digital gardening lies in the act of nurturing and connecting your thoughts and ideas (see [[GOB/Meta/Linking your thinking\|Linking your thinking]]), letting them grow over time, and pruning them when necessary. 

It's less structured than a [[GOB/Meta/Second Brain\|Second Brain]] and more organic. And unlike traditional blogging, which is often a performative act, digital gardening is more akin to a captain's log, a space for exploration, real-time editing, evolving thinking, and [[GOB/Meta/Learning in Public\|Learning in Public]].

Refer to Maggie Appleton's splendid essay on Digital Gardens: [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). It's of course a piece from [her own Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden).
