[[GOB/Meta/Difference between a Second Brain and a Digital Garden\|Difference between a Second Brain and a Digital Garden]]


My current setup is having both 
- a Second brain -> [[GOB/Meta/My Second Brain\|GOB/Meta/My Second Brain]]
- a Digital Garden -> [[GOB/Garden of Bits\|Garden of Bits]]

# My Second Brain
My personal [[GOB/Meta/Second Brain\|Second Brain]] was built on [uwidev/memory-flow-interface](https://github.com/uwidev/memory-flow-interface). It is a demo for a basic Obsidian working environment. Blessings to you [uwi](https://github.com/uwidev.

My Second Brain has 3 purposes:
1. Planning & Getting things done
2. Generate knowledge 
3. Journal 


</div></div>


Second Brain grew large. No notes published. I learned about [[GOB/Meta/Digital Gardens\|Digital Gardens]] and it all made sense. Why should I write for an audience when I can start to write for myself. The idea is that I publish notes without making them perfect. They are notes after all, not scientific papers.

Planning & GTD will stay in [[GOB/Meta/My Second Brain\|My Second Brain]], as well as most of my Journaling and Alignment. 

But my generate knowledge and connected ideas will slowly go from `Resources` to [[GOB/Garden of Bits\|Garden of Bits]].
