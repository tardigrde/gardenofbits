**Magic happens when you're fully engaged in flow state, connecting ideas like puzzle pieces, and unveiling your unique brilliance along the way.**

## Prioritizing Connection over Accumulation

Constantly amassing knowledge in real-time is not the key. Instead, we must enhance our abilities to cultivate and establish connections among the knowledge we already possess.

## Embracing Insights, Not Just Highlights

Elaborate highlighting methods often encourage the habit of "collecting without digesting." Excessive note-taking can hinder your most profound thinking and jeopardize the long-term vitality of your Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system.

## Valuing Your Perspective over Others'

You can't cultivate your unique perspective if you're continually highlighting the thoughts of others. Dive into the parts where they are engaging in their most profound thinking.


## Prioritizing Links over Folders

We are involved in "Knowledge" Management, not "Information Resource" Management. To construct useful knowledge, foster creative ideas, and make significant leaps in insight, you must master the art of linking ideas in a robust and future-proof manner.


## Prioritizing Ideas over Tasks

If your aim is task accomplishment, study GTD (Getting Things Done). If your goal is to build a vast universe of ideas that you nurture throughout your life, adopt LYT (Learn Your Trade) or [[GOB/Meta/Digital Gardens\|Digital Gardens]].

Note to myself: what if I want to do both? See [[GOB/Meta/How to marry Second Brain with Digital Garden\|How to marry Second Brain with Digital Garden]].

## PKM Over Productivity
  
Ironically, it's when you stop exploiting and start exploring, that you generate some of your best ideas and insights!
You may not know this, but you have a choice. You donâ€™t have to serve your task manager. Take the power back. Choose to be led by the carrot of curiosity over stick of a task list.
