My current setup is having both a private [[GOB/Meta/My Second Brain\|Second Brain]] and a public [[GOB/Garden of Bits\|Digital Garden]] (see [[GOB/Meta/Difference between a Second Brain and a Digital Garden\|differences]] between the 2 concepts).

[[GOB/Meta/My Second Brain\|My Second Brain]] grew large over time, yet no notes were ever published (see [[GOB/Meta/Cult of Done\|Cult of Done]]). Then I learned about [[GOB/Meta/Digital Gardens\|Digital Gardens]] and I fell in love with the idea. Why should I write for an audience when I can start to write for myself. The idea is that I publish notes without making them perfect. They are notes after all, not scientific papers.

[[200 Resources/201 Memory Flow Interface/Getting Things Done\|Getting Things Done]], as well as most of my personal journaling and [[200 Resources/201 Memory Flow Interface/Alignment\|Alignment]] will stay in [[GOB/Meta/My Second Brain\|My Second Brain]]. But my generated knowledge and connected ideas will slowly go from Second Brain `Resources` to my [[GOB/Garden of Bits\|Digital Garden]].
