# Second Brain

## Definition

The `Second Brain` is - as coined by Tiago Forte - "**an external, centralized, digital repository for the things you learn**Â and the resources from which they come". 

It is a method of externalizing your thoughts, ideas, and information into a digital system. It is a framework designed for [[GOB/Meta/Personal Knowledge Management\|Personal Knowledge Management]]. This system can be a note-taking app, a project management tool, or any other digital tool that allows you to store and organize in formation. The goal is to free up mental space by storing information that resonates with you externally, and to create a system that helps you to recall and use that information effectively when [[900 Archive/201 Memory Flow Interface/Getting Things Done\|Getting Things Done]] or doing [[900 Archive/201 Memory Flow Interface/Alignment\|Alignment]] (TODO publish).
