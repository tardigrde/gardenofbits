# My Second Brain
My personal [[GOB/Meta/Second Brain\|Second Brain]] was built on [uwidev/memory-flow-interface](https://github.com/uwidev/memory-flow-interface). It is a demo for a basic Obsidian working environment. Blessings to you [uwi](https://github.com/uwidev.

1. Planning & Getting things done
2. Generate knowledge 
3. Journal
