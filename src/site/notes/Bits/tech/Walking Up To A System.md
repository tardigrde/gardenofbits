# Walking Up To A System

**Run the system**: Run the code, and relate the concepts you see in the running system back to the code itself.

**Explore the architecture**: Get an overview of the system by exploring the package structure.

**Look more deeply**: Look at how classes relate to one another using the simple (but somewhat dangerous!) approach of taking definitions away and seeing what breaks -- don't be afraid to break things! 

5-step process:
1. Look at files and folders first
2. Run the program
3. Relate the app to the code
4. Analyze inter-package relationships maybe with an UML
5. Inter-file relationships
