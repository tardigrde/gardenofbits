> Hello World!

It's my first blog post on Garden of Bits. It's really an experiment of publishing my notes. I'll be focusing on digital technologies, and how to best leverage them. Two main topics will be [[Bits/tech/Decentralized Cloud Computing\|Decentralized Cloud Computing]] and [[Bits/tech/AI\|AI]]
