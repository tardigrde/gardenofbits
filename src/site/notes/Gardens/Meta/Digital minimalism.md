# Digital minimalism

Dugital minimalism is a type of minimalism, applied to your digital environment. Should you have smart devices, digital accounts, files, private keys, credential, applications, notifications, they all fall into your digital environment.

Why?

If you are a 90s kid, chances are you are using computers for more than 20 years. If you understand how files work, you probably also have some digital legacy, e.g. old photos, documents. Basically you have a considerable digital footprint.

Lets look at 3 stories that highlight, why digital minimalism is important.

Lets start with photo copies of real world documents.
You know the story. You are asked to send a photo copy of your National ID card. You had this like dozens of time. If you did not keep it, you need to do it againï¿½ 
But you probably have it. But where? Was it last year spring or summer when you last did it? Should you invest the time to search for it? Or just do the whole process again? If there is no central or at least well known place you are storing this document, you will have hard time getting it.

Another one is is using different SSOs for different services

You want to login to a site where you already have an account. Did you use SSO? If so, was it Google? Or Apple, or maybe Facebook? You definitely do not want to create another account right?


Third one is passwords. Most people I ask has zero to no password management. They might have some passwords written on a piece of paper. But where is it when it is most needed?
They might have it in memory. But how many passwords can you memorize? I know lot of people using the same building blocks with some logic for assembling unque passwords. Then you can technically memorize much more passwords. But is this really the way?
How do you know where did you use what version?

All of these stories describe situations where you already have some digital footprint, but you are unable to reuse it long after producing it. People at this point usually produce more footprint. New photo, Password reset email + new password. In IT project rhis is analogous to technical debt.

Remember, your digitalnspace is very similar to your phyaical space in many ways. If you keep order in your room, why wouldnt you keep order on your computer? 

How

How to keep your digitalnspace minimal?
Its a question Ive been asking myself for years. It involves many things, and it does not have a clear answer. Letï¿½s look at some aspects.

You want to have certain groups of digital data in a cetral
place.
Its your digital data, so decentralization dors not help, only makes things more complex. Distributing the data on the other hand, while still adds to the complexity, it is useful if you want to avoid risk of platform lock-in, data storage service/device failures.

Lets take photos as an a perfect example. Ive bern collecting photos of myself, my family, the events I attended and so on. Although the photos vere created by maybe hundreds of distinct cameras, the photos are are archived to a single place. I believe its something a lot of us do. Be it dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, HDD/SSD, all photos are in a single folder. To achieve this, you may want to archive your photos several times a year. Itï¿½s time you have to spend and prioritize, but at the end its worth it. All your photos eill be available and searchable in a single place.

Same goes for documents. Be it digitalncertificates, photo copies of realnworldmdocuments,vouchers. Or any note you take, especially if it can be reused later. These should all be accessible feom a central place. 

Projects you work/ed on and related digital data is no different.
If you do some centralization, like described above
You will end up with a couple of file system folders. Ultimately you can group all of these important folders to create your legacy digital database.

When you have this, that folder abstracts everything you have inside. This is a single entity which you can now do stuff with. You can start versioning it, make copies of it, distribute it, back it up.

See the process? You took little pieces that fit together and made a single source of truth version out of it. You gave it a name and now you are able to talk about and act on it as a single entity. Even if there are 100k files in the folder.
