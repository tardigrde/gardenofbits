# Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a minimalist Markdown text editor that comes with some very powerful features. Although not open-source, it's free to use. And the ability to add community plugins allows you to tailor the system to your specific needs.

All your documents are stored locally on your hard drive. There's no reliance on proprietary cloud-based software; the only requirements are you and your computer. This system is truly yours to manipulate and control. You're in charge; it's [all yours](https://obsidian.md/about)

## What can you do with Obsidian?
At it's core it's a great note taking tool. But this is extended by the available features and plugins. You can seamlessly build a personal Wiki-like experience. You can use it as a productivity management tool. You can also build a [Second Brain](https://petermeglis.com/blog/unlock-your-brains-potential-a-beginners-guide-to-obsidian-and-building-a-second-brain/). Or a [[Gardens/Meta/Digital Gardens\|Digital Garden]].
## Getting started
If you feel like giving it a try, go to [Getting started - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian). Watching some YouTube tutorials would surely help as well, to see how people use it.

## Obsidian Plugins
My go to plugins always include:
- [Obsidian Tasks](https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks) 
- [Obsidian Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) 
- [Obsidian Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)
- [Obsidian Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)  
- [Obsidian Calendar Plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) 

There is a thriving ecosystem around Obsidian, so your wish is most probably implemented by somebody.
